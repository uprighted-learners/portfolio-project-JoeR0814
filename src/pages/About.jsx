          <p>
            Hello, My name is Joe Reis. I am first and foremost a family man. I
            have been fortunate to have a very loving and supportive family. My
            son plays a big role in my life. He is part of everything I do
            (outside of work.) I enjoy teaching him the things I know. I have
            been caring for him since his birth and I try to be the best I can
            be so he can have a great role model to look up to! I have had many
            opportunities in different fields, such as in the construction field
            as a laborer and as automotive mechanic. Anything with an engine, I
            can diagnose and repair. When I am asked what I do for work I like
            to say, “I am a Jack of all trades, master of none!" Meaning in my
            words, as a laborer, I had to learn a lot of the different trades
            applicable to a job site. I had to learn their tools and their
            materials to get the job done. Whether it would be paving a highway,
            heavy machine operator, or to assist the electrician, carpenter,
            iron worker or plumber, I did whatever it took to get the job done.
            I can be relied upon to be a great team player. I have seen fathers,
            grandfathers and several uncles have worked in the construction
            field. Some of them suffered serious injuries. By the time they
            retired, they were left with much pain from years of abusing their
            bodies. I want to change the cycle of construction workers in my
            family. I want my son to see there is a better way to earn a living.
            I can now teach my son how to work with his hands. This is the
            exciting part, to pass down to him what I know. I started working in
            construction in 2011, as a Union member. Prior to that, I was an
            Automotive Mechanic. In 2006, after High School graduation, I
            enrolled in a one-year tech school for Automotive, graduating with a
            certificate in Automotive Mechanics. When I was younger, I would fix
            the tractor and other small engines. At ages 14, 15, I started
            working on cars with a friend. It was then that I found my passion
            for engines. I was totally intrigued by the inside of the engine.
            Automotive will always be something I enjoy as a hobby! Because the
            Automotive field did not bring the salary I desired, in 2011, I
            joined the Laborers’ Construction Union. The Construction field
            allowed me to also experience how things were designed and built.
            Learning how things are built and / or function is really something
            that motivates me to learn the “how”. I like to think of myself as
            having a mind LIKE AND ENGINEER! The way technology is always
            changing, with many cars now being electric and the homes being
            smart homes, etc., has inspired me to start my next chapter in my
            career as a Software Developer. I am proud to say that I am
            specializing in Full Stack Software Development/Engineering,
            JavaScript language. I am excited to continue to learn. One of my
            strongest attributes is to figure out how things work by using my
            hands and my mind by researching and perseverance. I am assertive
            when it comes to challenges and hard work. I will do what it takes
            to solve any problem that comes my way. I am a great team player. I
            will work with my team and prove to my team and/or manager that I am
            a hard worker. It gives me a great deal of satisfaction and
            happiness to be able to solve problems by researching in many
            different forms, as needed. I find that I learn more things while in
            the process of solving a particular problem. I believe that in this
            new chapter that I’m pursuing, my learning will continue to evolve.
            In this portfolio, you will see the languages I know and the tools I
            use to build the projects to code with. Thank you for taking the
            time to read this, learn a little about me and the new skills I have
            acquired. I hope you have a great day! Sincerely,
          </p>
